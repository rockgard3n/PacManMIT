# PacManMIT
## An edge detection and DOM exercise

When a user loads this program they will have the option to add PacMen to the DOM via the "Add PacMen" button. The user can add any number of PacMen to the screen. Once they are satisfied they then hit "Start Game." This initiates the PacMen's random navigation across the screen. Each PacMen will chomp their way across the screen with a different randomly generated direction and velocity. When a PacMan hits a boundary of the window, it will reverse direction and begin chomping away from the edge. 

# How to Run
To run just go [here](https://rockgard3n.github.io/PacManMIT/)

If you would like to modify my code feel free to clone the repository! 

# Future Improvements
Having the PacMen interact with each other is a future goal of mine. So rather than crossing over each other they would impact and reverse direction. Or maybe one would "eat" the other.
